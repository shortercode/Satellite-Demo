# Satellite-Demo
Flawed but pretty attempt to simulate gravity in 2D

Simulates distance and mass dependant gravity for a collection of satellites around a point of attraction. 

Mostly works but doesn't take into account variation in between "ticks" which leads to a slow increase in energy.

Can be quite slow, code could do with some refactoring and the satellite tails aren't totally performant.
